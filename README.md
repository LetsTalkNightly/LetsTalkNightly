ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @LetsTalkNightly
ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in constantly improving/expanding my knowledge and understanding of the programming world.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying a HND in Applied Computing, in hopes of becoming a software developer.

I plan on releasing very basic projects onto GitHub at first, and then gradually start working on more complicated projects. 
My goal is to train myself and become the ideal candidate for the majority of coding jobs available right now.
